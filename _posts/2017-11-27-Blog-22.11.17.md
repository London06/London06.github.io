  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I started off having little knowledge of Scratch (only the basic movements) and quite unsure of how to work Scratch.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To start the Space Invaders game's main Sprites and the main coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, for I could not finish my game and now have to do slightly more in class.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
