**80's Games Review’s-**

**1.-Pong**

**This game is simply to connect the block; or what is the racket, to the ball and it simply bounces off. The game has three different sprites (two rackets, or four in the two player version)  and of course the ball. The backdrop is a simple all black picture with a white line acting as the net in the middle. It has a few variables: they are one player where you only control one racket, two player: where you control two rackets on the same side and starter mode where it shows how to play.**

**2.Pacman-**

**This is an easy to work out game where you just have to eat up 'food' or ‘points’ and after a while the other 4 ‘monsters’ turn into ghosts and you have a chance to get a cherry; for 100 hundred points. There are 5 sprites and 0 variables.**

**3.Donkey Kong-**

**In this game all you have to do is try and get the princess from Donkey Kong who is throwing barrels down; these barrels restart the game if you hit them. There are 4 main sprites. However, there are lots of metal bars which you run on and ladders to climb up. Of course aswell there are unlimited barrels being thrown down. There are harder levels every time you complete a level for this game, in the harder levels there are more frequent barrels being thrown.**

**4.Tetris-**

**In this game you have to try and make lines of shapes while all the time the shapes are gradually moving down. Also, you get a better score more you go quicker. This has unlimited sprites (only the shapes) if you keep on progressing through the levels.**

**5.Space Invaders-**

**In this game you have to shoot down the 55 spaceships while there shooting you. In total there's 55 ships, 1 of you, 1 occasional red spaceship and 3 blocks keeping you safe (every time it’s hit though by you or the spaceships it gets smaller) equalling 60 sprites.**
